Possible data issues

        chemical_compositions
            Sum of percentages does not have to equal 100
            English names should be converted to scientific notation in compound
            missing/incorrect data needs to be differentiated from 0s
                should that sample be excluded?  What is the expected behavior    
            All samples in chemical_compositions comes in with the same order and same set of compounds
                safe to assume this will always be the case? 
                    likely not, but in this case using it as a constant seems safe.  
                Would want to apply additional checks prior to processing to confirm in the future
            Should lat_long be one field or two?  
                Depends on eventual storage and access goals, for now we'll leave it as two

        assay_samples

        overall
            Both individual values and calculated mineral composition values should be within 0-100 as they represent percentages
                Not clear from the prompt how this should be handled; likely there are some presumed upper bounds to some of the percentages that could be applied by compound (TiO2 seems like it goes from 0-10 at most, being generous, so could assume extra 0s in the number marking it to 50 or 100 could be removed/made into missing decimal points)
            should samples be rejected if total mineral comp in assay_samples doesn't match calculated total? 
            Should we spend time calculating the total, and ignore the provided total? 
            Use both and mark mismatches?

            If we have sample ids in one file that aren't present in another, should we ingest partial data or reject?

    company2
        long,lat- preference towards ISO 6709 personally, so will default to that and change the order
        contains the first four compound types from chemical_compositions
        structure found here more closely mimics the likely structured data store, makes sense to standardize towards this
            this means we'll need to add columns for additional compound types for interim data structure
            would prefer to standardize on scientific notation for compounds as they are the clearest representation
        No totals listed, so not possible to make comparisons to prove validity

sample ids should be saved, along with company id (and probably source file name to trace back any issues), but new ids should be generated within our system


Final CSV columns
    company_name,sample_id,lat,long,SiO2,TiO2,Al2O3,FeO3,MnO,MgO,CaO,K2O,Na2O,total_mineral_composition,calculated_mineral_composition


Assumptions
    company 1
        both files contain the same sample ids

        assay_samples
            sample ids are provided in ascending order

        chemical_compositions samples:
            ALWAYS have 9 compound types
            compound types are in the same order
            sample ids are provided in ascending order

    


    non-matching total/calculated compositions are fine
    coordinate resolution is recorded as is, and no issue with 5 vs 6 decimal points
    if additional compounds were added to company 2s csv, they would appear in the same order as company 1 chemical_compositions


Output
    Company 1
        Read by sample id in 'assay_samples'
            skip if no numeric sample id
                could also store read ids to ensure no duplication (or de-dupe in a previous step)
            split lat/long 
            iterate through chemical_compositions until new sample_id
            Replace invalid percentages with 'None' (valid range is 0-100)
            calculate mineral composition percentage
        Output into soil_sample_data.py
    Company 2
        Read by sample id in 'assays'
            Replace invalid percentages with NaN (valid range is 0-100)
            Enrich with null values for missing compound types
            calculate mineral composition percentage
